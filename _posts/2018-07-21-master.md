During my master thesis I implemented an algorithm that predicts the future position of a vessel based on AIS data. The algorithm uses a close neighbor approach, where it assumes the vessel will continue with a velocity similar to historical neighbors from the dataset. In addition, I modified an existing collision avoidance algorithm for autonomous vessels to include the new prediction algorithm.

The image shows the obstacle vessel in red and its predicted future position is given by the multi-colored distribution, where the predicted position is given by a new color for every minute. The autonomous vessel is shown in blue, and its planned path is given by the crosses. For more details see my [master thesis]({{ "/assets/masteroppgave.pdf" | absolute_url }}).
